# Companion — resolved N=256 Taylor–Green DNS (Re=1600): the gated verdicts, resolved

**2026-06-02.** The first run to use the real ~6-hour compute budget (prior runs were
~10 min at N=64–128). A **resolved** viscous Taylor–Green DNS at **N=256, Re=1600** — the
canonical Brachet-1983 benchmark — turning the resolution-GATED diagnostics (`S_ω` bounded
vs growing; production-set dimension; `δ` convergence) into **resolved** verdicts on a flow
validated against the literature. Scope: 3D pseudospectral DNS truncation (resolved). NOT
the PDE; `:proved`=0.

## §1 — Computational basis

- **Source (new):** `scripts/dns_tg256.jl` (+ `.out.txt`; N=64 smoke `dns_tg256_N64.out.txt`).
  Threaded radix-2 FFT (6 threads), reuses `spectral_3d_control.jl`. Std-lib Julia.
- **Run:** viscous TG, `N=256`, `ν=1/1600`, `dt=0.005`, `T=10`, sample every 0.5. Wall-clock
  ~3.8 h (6.7 s/step × 2000 steps + diagnostics). Solver pre-validated at N=256 (E/H
  conserved to 1e-6 on a 10-step inviscid check); pipeline pre-smoked at N=64.
- **Diagnostics per sample:** E, H, Z, ‖ω‖∞, `δ(t)` (analyticity strip), `S_ω=⟨ω·(ω·∇)u⟩/⟨|ω|²⟩^{3/2}`
  (vortex-stretching production skewness), `D_box` (box-counting dim of the top-50%-production set).

## §2 — Results

**Validation (Brachet 1983).** Enstrophy peaks at **t=9.0** (`Z/Z₀=27.4`), then decays —
the canonical TG Re=1600 dissipation-peak time. Energy decays monotonically (1.0→0.596);
helicity ~1e-18 throughout (TG symmetry exact). The hand-rolled hermetic solver reproduces
the published DNS benchmark at N=256.

| t | E/E₀ | Z/Z₀ | ‖ω‖∞ | δ | S_ω | D_box |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.0 | 1.000 | 1.0 | 2.0 | 3.54 | 0.00 | 2.43 |
| 4.0 | 0.972 | 4.4 | 13.8 | 0.108 | **0.276** | **1.82** |
| 4.5 | 0.962 | 6.5 | 24.3 | 0.096 | **0.290** | 1.83 |
| 9.0 | 0.690 | **27.4** | 66.9 | **0.077** | 0.213 | 1.96 |
| 10.0 | 0.596 | 24.5 | 73.1 | 0.079 | 0.198 | 2.02 |

**Resolved verdicts:**
1. **`S_ω` BOUNDED** — transient peak 0.29 at t≈4 (steepening), then settles to ~0.2 through
   the enstrophy peak and decay. Does *not* grow. The "bounded vs growing" gate, resolved at
   N=256: **bounded ≈ 0.2.** No blowup signature (expected at Re=1600).
2. **`δ(t)` bounded** — min 0.077 at the enstrophy peak, never → 0, well-resolved
   (`δ·k_cut ≈ 6.5 ≫ 1`). The diagnostic correctly reports regularity on a resolved flow
   (NS-010 viscous control, confirmed at 256).
3. **`D_box` DYNAMIC** — dips to **1.82 at t≈4** (exactly when `S_ω` peaks and ‖ω‖∞ jumps to
   ~14), recovers to ~2.0. The production set **localizes toward the CKN ≤1 / NS-037 filament
   limit at peak stretching** but bottoms at ~1.8 — never collapsing to ≤1. The earlier N≤128
   "static D≈2.3" was under-resolved; at N=256 the production set is a ~1.8–2.0-dim object
   that *transiently localizes* under stretching.

## §3 — Verification

**Type — computed (resolved DNS).**
- *Validation:* the enstrophy peak at t=9.0 matches the canonical Brachet-1983 Re=1600 TG
  dissipation-peak time (peak *time* is the robust benchmark; magnitude is
  normalization-dependent and not over-claimed). Energy monotone-decaying, H≈0 — solver correct.
- *Resolution:* `δ·k_cut ≈ 6.5` at the enstrophy peak ⇒ the analyticity strip is wider than
  the grid scale ⇒ the flow is resolved (unlike the inviscid N≤128 under-resolved runs).
- *S_ω:* bounded ~0.2 across the developed regime; computed from the full velocity-gradient
  tensor (15 transforms/sample).
- *D_box:* 5-scale box-count (scales 2..32 → boxes 128³..8³), ±~0.15 fit uncertainty; the
  2.0→1.82 dip is a real but modest localization signature, not a sharp collapse.

**Honest scope.** Re=1600 TG is a *regular* flow — these verdicts confirm regularity at
resolved scale; they are not a blowup test. The value is methodological: the previously
resolution-gated diagnostics now have *trustworthy* (resolved, literature-validated) values,
and the dynamic `D`-localization to ~1.8 at peak stretching is a new, resolved observation
tying to NS-037 (the attractor toward the CKN wall — here, time-resolved).

## §4 — Spec impact

Proposes **NS-038 — "Resolved N=256 DNS verdicts (the boundary-exploration program)"**
(candidate; DEFERRED — recommend formalizing after the boundary queue A→B→C runs so NS-038
covers the resolved-DNS program as a whole). It would: strengthen **NS-010** (`δ` bounded +
resolved at N=256), and refine **NS-037** (`S_ω` bounded ≈0.2 resolved; the static D≈2.3
replaced by a dynamic dip to ~1.8 at peak stretching — the production set localizes toward
but does not reach the CKN ≤1). Evidence: computed (resolved DNS, literature-validated);
Status `:tested`; Scope: resolved 3D DNS truncation; `:proved`=0.

*Firewall: resolved 3D pseudospectral DNS truncation; NOT the PDE; the prize untouched.
`:proved`=0. Metabolized by Claude, 2026-06-02.*
