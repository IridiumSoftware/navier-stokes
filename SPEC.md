## PROBLEM

**NS-001 — The Clay statement.**
For 3D incompressible Navier–Stokes on 𝕋³ or ℝ³ with smooth, finite-energy
initial data and zero forcing (or Schwartz forcing), prove **either** global-in-
time existence of smooth finite-energy solutions, **or** a finite-time
singularity. 2D is solved (global regularity); 3D is open.
- Evidence: external-theorem (problem statement). **Status: :open.** Scope: PDE.

## OBSTRUCTIONS (the walls any proof must respect)

**NS-002 — Supercriticality of the energy norm (THE central obstruction).**
Under the NS scaling symmetry `u_λ(x,t) = λ u(λx, λ²t)`, the energy norm scales as
`‖u_λ‖_{L²}² = λ^{-1}‖u‖_{L²}² → 0` as `λ→∞` (zooming into small scales). So the
*controlled* quantity (energy) is asymptotically **useless at the scales where a
singularity would live**. The scale-*invariant* ("critical") norms — `L³`,
`Ḣ^{1/2}`, `BMO^{-1}` — are exactly the borderline ones, and none is globally
controlled a priori. This supercriticality is the structural reason 3D is open
and 2D (where the controlled enstrophy sits on the right side of scaling) is not.
- Evidence: argued (standard). **Status: :argued.** Scope: PDE.
- Source: standard; see Tao's expositions on criticality.

**NS-003 — Energy is the only coercive global control (Leray).**
Global weak (Leray–Hopf) solutions exist for all time and obey the energy
inequality, controlling `‖u(t)‖_{L²}` and `∫₀ᵀ‖∇u‖_{L²}²`. This controls *size*,
not *derivatives pointwise*; weak solutions may be non-unique / non-smooth.
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited.** Scope: PDE.
- Source: Leray (1934); Hopf (1951).

**NS-004 — Beale–Kato–Majda: blowup ⇒ unbounded vortex stretching.**
A solution smooth on `[0,T)` extends past `T` iff `∫₀ᵀ ‖ω(t)‖_{L∞} dt < ∞`. So any
finite-time singularity **requires** the vorticity-`L∞` integral to diverge —
i.e. unbounded vortex stretching. Any blowup construction must engineer this.
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited.** Scope: PDE.
- Source: Beale–Kato–Majda (1984).

**NS-005 — Conditional (critical-norm) regularity: Prodi–Serrin–Ladyzhenskaya.**
If `u ∈ L^p_t L^q_x` with `2/p + 3/q ≤ 1`, `q>3`, the solution is smooth (endpoint
`L^∞_t L³_x`: Escauriaza–Seregin–Šverák 2003). ⇒ a singularity requires a
*critical* norm to blow up. Reduces "prove regularity" to "control a critical
norm" — which NS-002 says we cannot do a priori.
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited.** Scope: PDE.
- Source: Prodi (1959), Serrin (1962), Ladyzhenskaya; ESS (2003).

**NS-006 — Caffarelli–Kohn–Nirenberg partial regularity.**
For suitable weak solutions, the singular set `S` has parabolic Hausdorff
dimension `≤ 1` (1D in space-time). Singularities, if they exist, are small and
cannot fill a region.
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited.** Scope: PDE.
- Source: Caffarelli–Kohn–Nirenberg (1982); Scheffer.

**NS-007 — No exact self-similar blowup (the easiest backward path is dead).**
Leray's (-1/2)-self-similar blowup ansatz `u(x,t)=(2a(T−t))^{-1/2}U((x−x₀)/√(2a(T−t)))`
has **no nontrivial solution** in `L³`/energy space. The cleanest "assume it blows
up and read off the profile" construction is ruled out; only asymptotically /
discretely self-similar profiles survive, none constructed for real NS.
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited (rules out an approach).** Scope: PDE.
- Source: Nečas–Růžička–Šverák (1996); Tsai (1998).

**NS-008 — Tao's averaged-NS blowup (a no-go for energy-only methods).**
An *averaged* 3D NS equation sharing the exact energy identity and scaling **does
blow up in finite time** (a self-replicating cascade gadget). Therefore **no proof
of regularity can use only the energy identity + scaling**, because such a proof
would falsely also rule out the averaged equation. Any successful method must use
finer structure of the true nonlinearity (e.g. vortex-stretching geometry).
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited (barrier on methods).** Scope: PDE.
- Source: Tao (2016), *Finite time blowup for an averaged 3D NS equation*, JAMS.

**NS-009 — Onsager / anomalous-dissipation threshold = 1/3.**
Energy is conserved for Euler solutions above Hölder `1/3` (Constantin–E–Titi
1994); dissipative weak Euler solutions exist at/below `1/3` (Isett 2018;
Buckmaster–De Lellis–Székelyhidi–Vicol 2019). The exponent `1/3` is simultaneously
Kolmogorov's increment law `δu(ℓ)~(εℓ)^{1/3}` and the root of the exact 4/5 law.
Frames the inviscid limit / cascade rigorously.
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited.** Scope: PDE (Euler) / inviscid limit.

## DIAGNOSTICS (computable detectors of blowup — the live tools)

**NS-010 — Analyticity-strip width δ(t) (THE blowup diagnostic).**
A smooth solution is Gevrey-/real-analytic and extends to complex spatial
arguments, analytic in a strip `|Im z| < δ(t)`; `δ(t)` equals the exponential
decay rate of the Fourier spectrum, `|û(k,t)| ~ C(t) e^{−δ(t)|k|}`. **`δ(t)→0` in
finite time is exactly a loss of analyticity / approach to singularity.** Directly
computable from a spectral solution.
- Evidence: external-theorem (method) → **computed (forthcoming here).**
  **Status: :argued / :open** (no computation in-repo yet → will become `:tested`).
- Scope: PDE (method) / will be ODE-truncation when we compute it.
- Source: Foias–Temam (1989); Sulem–Sulem–Frisch (1983).

**NS-011 — Complex-singularity tracking.**
The nearest complex-space singularity (pole/branch point) of the analytic
continuation, at distance `δ(t)` from the real axis; **its migration to the real
axis = blowup.** Tracked via the spectrum's decay rate and form. The rigorous home
of the "assume it blows up and work backward" instinct.
- Evidence: external-theorem (method). **Status: :argued / :open** here.
- Scope: PDE (method). Source: Sulem–Sulem–Frisch (1983); Matsumoto–Bec–Frisch.

## LIVE APPROACHES & CONJECTURES

**NS-012 — Li–Sinai: finite-time blowup for COMPLEX initial data.**
Finite-time blowup is **proved** for 3D NS with complex initial data via a
renormalization-group / fixed-point construction. The backward (blowup-
construction) path **succeeds in the complex setting**; the real-data problem
remains open. Strong reason to take the complex plane seriously (NS-010/011).
- Evidence: external-theorem. **Status: :cited.** Scope: PDE with complex data
  (NOT the real-data prize). Source: Dong Li & Ya. G. Sinai (2008), JEMS.

**NS-013 — Does complex-data blowup inform real-data regularity?**
Open. Complex blowup (NS-012) and the analyticity-strip picture (NS-010) suggest
the real-data question is "does the nearest complex singularity reach the real
axis," but no implication real⇐complex is established.
- Evidence: none. **Status: :open.** Scope: PDE. Source: —

## OUR RESULTS (this arc — every one scoped; none is PDE progress)

**NS-020 — Homological reformulation: FALSIFIED.**
A proposed reformulation casting incompressibility/closure in chain-complex
homology (H₁, "repair cost") was tested and falsified: on fixed domains `b₁` is
pinned under mesh refinement (𝕋³→3, ℝ³→0); it grows only under topology change;
and the genuine difficulty lives entirely in the **norm choice** (= NS-002), which
homology cannot see. Repair-cost = 1/vorticity exactly.
- Evidence: computed. **Status: :falsified.** Scope: discrete-topology diagnostic.
- Source: `scripts/navier_stokes_homology_diagnostic.jl` (+ .out.txt).

**NS-021 — Turbulence-as-residue phenomenology (MFE saddle).**
The Moehlis–Faisst–Eckhardt 9-mode model (eqs pinned to source) reproduces the
self-sustaining-process phenomenology: a metastable turbulent state with
**memoryless (exponential) lifetime**, `τ(Re) ~ exp(B·Re)` with `B≈0.013–0.015`
(amplitude-invariant, geometry-dependent), and recovery **gated by the roll mode
a₃** (committor decomposition).
- Evidence: computed. **Status: :tested.**
  **Scope: ODE-truncation / phenomenology — a 9-variable ODE is smooth for all
  time by construction; NO bearing on PDE regularity.**
- Source: `scripts/mfe_self_sustaining.jl`, `mfe_lifetime_scaling.jl`,
  `mfe_B_universality.jl`, `mfe_escape_mechanism.jl`, `mfe_committor_decomposition.jl`.

**NS-022 — Helical triad: cascade direction is an ensemble property.**
The Waleffe-1992 reduced helical triad (exact E & H conservation to ~1e-13) shows
the intermediate-signed leg is the unstable donor with a conservation-fixed split,
but the *isolated* triad merely oscillates — forward vs inverse transfer is a
*driven-ensemble* property, not the triad algebra.
- Evidence: computed. **Status: :tested. Scope: 3-ODE model / phenomenology.**
- Source: `scripts/triad_closure_vs_cascade.jl`.

**NS-023 — Autopoietic-closure phenomenology + the (M,R) gate.**
Decay-default + autocatalytic closure (stochastic CTMC) reproduces the same
metastable + memoryless + `τ(ρ)~exp(N·g(ρ))` class *intrinsically*. The Rosen
(M,R) 3-role triad has an exact, pre-registered, null-controlled **gate = target
of the weak edge, rotation-covariant**; the seam is simultaneously *lifeline and
death-route*, with a lifespan-vs-identity tightness tradeoff. Canonical CFS
quotient (Q₁₀₂) is too symmetric to localize a gate (robust negative).
- Evidence: computed. **Status: :tested.**
  **Scope: abstract closure theory — a SEPARATE domain, NOT NS.** A self-contained
  result about autopoietic closure; included here as the arc's record.
- Source: `scripts/closure_autopoiesis_{small,structured,canon}.jl`,
  `closure_{knfamily_scaling,mr_gate,q102_richgate,triad_rotation,offgas}.jl`.

**NS-024 — Closure↔turbulence convergence: witness-trimmed to broad/generic.**
A claimed convergence (the GPG-foundations confluence/Order result vs the seam
arc) was put to a 3-seat external witness pass (Grok/Gemini/ChatGPT). Verdict:
**C1 holds but is broad** (closed/symmetric=inert; open=needs a degeneracy-breaker
— kin to spontaneous symmetry breaking, not a special bond); **C2 "Order=seam"
identity is DEAD** (doubly dissociable); **C3 origin-unification REFUTED**. The
deep "is the seam's incompleteness one notion or two?" answered **two**.
- Evidence: argued (externally witnessed). **Status: :argued.**
  **Scope: abstract structural analogy — NO analytic purchase on the PDE.**
- Source: `docs/seam_order_convergence_witness_{brief,verdict}.md`.

## RELATED (external work bearing on the closure-theory side — NOT the PDE)

**NS-025 — Gosme: causal symmetrization as an empirical signature of operational
closure.** Anthony Gosme, *Causal symmetrization as an empirical signature of
operational autonomy in complex systems*, arXiv:2512.09352 (Dec 2025). Empirically
operationalizes the closure-to-efficient-causation / (M,R) / autopoiesis framework
on **50 collaborative software ecosystems** (11,042 system-months). Order parameter
`Γ` (structural persistence under component turnover) is **bimodal** (Hartigan dip
p=0.0126; phase transition exploratory→mature, 1.77× variance collapse); at maturity
**"causal symmetrization"** emerges — Granger structure↔activity coupling shifts
0.71 (activity-driven) → 0.94 (bidirectional). A composite viability index
(activity+structural persistence) beats activity-alone (AUC 0.88 vs 0.81), flagging
**"structural zombies"** (sustained activity masking architectural decay). Author is
explicit: a *necessary statistical* signature *consistent with* operational closure,
**not** biological life or mechanistic closure; substrate-independent.
- Evidence: external-theorem (empirical study). **Status: :cited.**
- **Scope: software-ecosystems / phenomenology — NOT NS-PDE.** A Tier-2
  phenomenological diagnostic (per `physical_invariants.md`); **cannot bear on the
  prize.** Bears on NS-023/024 (the closure-theory side), not on regularity.
- Relevance: (a) an *independent external operationalization* of the (M,R)/closure
  framework we modeled abstractly (NS-023); (b) a concrete, testable bridge to our
  models — *does the symmetrization signature appear in the MFE saddle?* (structure
  = roll `a₃`, activity = perturbation energy, directional Granger coupling) →
  queued phenomenology experiment under NS-021, Scope: ODE-truncation.
- **CAUTION (flagged, NOT claimed):** Gosme's "symmetrization" (bidirectional
  *causal coupling* = mature closure) is a *different sense of symmetry* from our
  (M,R) result "*structural* symmetry → inert / the seam makes it alive" (NS-023).
  Do not conflate; witness any convergence before believing it (cf. NS-024).
  ("Structural zombie" rhymes with our "self-sustaining until it is not" —
  resonance to examine in the closure domain, not a PDE bridge.)

## PROGRAM (method & cross-project)

**NS-030 — The obstruction-program method (the transferable contribution).**
Maintain an evidence-tiered ledger of obstructions / diagnostics / falsified /
live approaches, with a firewall against conflating models with the PDE and
external witnessing of convergences. This *method* is the part that transfers to
the other open programs (CFS, closure-quotient, possibilistic-inversion);
substantive transfer requires per-claim scope + witness (cf. NS-024).
- Evidence: argued. **Status: :argued.** Scope: methodology.

---

*Open priority (see `dashboard.md`): compute NS-010/011 — the analyticity-strip /
complex-singularity diagnostic — starting with the exactly-solvable Burgers model,
then a spectral Euler/NS truncation. This is the first in-repo direction with
`Scope: PDE-method`; it remains a diagnostic in models, not a PDE proof.*
